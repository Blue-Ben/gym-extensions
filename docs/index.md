# gym-extensions

Welcome to **gym-extensions**! We're building on top of <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym">OpenAI Gym</a> in the pursuit of creating environments suitable for benchmarking a wide variety of auxiliary tasks. On the RoadMap right now are:

+ Multitask, Transfer, and LifeLong Learning Benchmarks
+ Learning to navigate and search tasks
+ More hardcore robotics tasks using ROS and Gazebo simulation

See [here](envs) for our environment specifications and descriptions.
